  <h1>DIG 245 View Source: The Golden Egg</h1>

  <p class="intro"> An introduction</p>

  <p> In this assignment, we are asked to teach someone
    how they can view the source code of a page, and what they can
    do with it.
    First, one may ask, how do I get to the source code of page? This
    is a question worth asking.</p>

  <p>
    To get to the source code of a web page, you must
  <ol>
    <li>Open up a browser. For me, my favorite is Google Chrome, so I will ask you
      in this tutorial to open up Google Chrome.
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to visit some website to inspect, so you can look at
      it's source code. For the sake of this tutoral, I have given you
      a link to Davidson's blog post about Stephen Curry's graduation.

      <a href="https://www.davidson.edu/news/2022/09/01/davidsons-stephen-curry-celebrates-graduation-hall-fame-induction-his-home-team" target="_blank">
        <br>
        <br>
        Click here to go to Davidson website </a>
    </li>
    <li> There are several ways from here to view the source code.
      The first and easiest way is to right click on any part of the page
      and scroll down on the options that come up until you see inspect. Click on
      that, and it should take you to the elements of the page.
      <br>
      The second way, if you have windows, it to click on the three floating
      dots in the right corner of you page, scroll down to more tools, and
      select developer tools.

      Lastly, you can also use keyboard shortcuts. Ctlr + Shift + I for
      Windows and Linux users or Cmd + Options + I for macOS users.
    </li>
  </ol>



  Now that you've been able to access the source code of a page, you might
  ask, why do I care to view the source code of a page?
  <br>
  <br>
  Well I would tell you, using DevTools is a powerful utility for anyone
  to have from the professional level down to the fun prankster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some things you can do with DevTools are:

  <ul>
    <li>
      View the content of a webpage to copy its code, change its colors
      and fonts, or even edit it for a prank.
      <br>
      <br>
      <!-- need to fix this. Can't have the path be local -->

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      View hidden passwords.

      Using the elements tab in the source code, you can navigate down
      to the part of the page that contains your password. Then if you change
      the type of the input tag from password to text and saving the changes
      you made by clicking any white background in the DevTools, you can see
      the previously hidden password.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Download images and videos from a website.

      For the image of myself I used in the Davidson post edit, I went
      to a another Davidson post that included a picture of me, and downloaded
      it before uploading it to my fake blog.

  Although you may be super excited with these newfound abilities, there are way
  possibilites for those who choose to look under the goose.

    If you want to be really cool and awesome, you can leave your own easter eggs
    for people to find. Just look at this awesome dino someone drew.

    To see the message for yourself, I've dropped a link to the site.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.qwantz.com/about.php" target="_blank"> Dino Site
    </a>
    <br>
    Once you have the page up, inspect the page like before, look under the
    elements tab, and once you scroll down far enough, you'll see your
    favorite dino!
  </p>

  <script>
    // alert("hello world!");
    console.log("A secret message only devs will see!");
    document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = "lavender";
